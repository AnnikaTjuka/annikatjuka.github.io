title: "Research visit in Oxford"
---

I started the new year in the UK! I'm a visiting researcher at the University of Oxford, working with <a href="[https://annikatjuka-bookshelf.github.io/](https://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-asifa-majid/)" target="_blank">Asifa Majid</a>. The next three months will be filled with research, collaboration, and lots of tea.
