    title: WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
    summary: |
      I’m a language scientist and currently working as a doctoral researcher at the MPI for the Science of Human History. I studied linguistics at Humboldt University Berlin, focusing on psycholinguistics and typology. My research interest is the diversity of language variation in word meanings. In my master’s thesis, I conducted the first systematic study of body part extensions such as the table leg and foot of the mountain. I examined the frequency of these expressions in 13 languages and the preferences for the underlying similarity dimensions (shape, spatial orientation, function). For my doctoral research, I collaborated in establishing the Database of Cross-Linguistic Norms, Ratings, and Relations for Words and Concepts (NoRaRe), which contains 98 datasets from linguistics and psychology across 40 languages including 65 properties (e.g., frequency, sensorimotor ratings, borrowability).

        link: "http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/j95n-c998"
        tagline: "A systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. The study consisted of 53 pictures illustrating object and landscape parts which were based on 93 body-part metaphors. The analysis showed that some metaphors are far more consistent across languages than others. For example, ‘leg of the chair/table’ is present throughout the whole language sample."

That is, speakers of German solve language tasks (mostly computer based), and we measure how quickly and accurately they can solve these tasks. Sometimes, we also measure their brain waves (with electroencephalography, EEG for short) or the involvement of certain brain areas in the language tasks (with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI for short)."
