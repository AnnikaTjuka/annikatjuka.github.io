career-profile:
    title: Research Profile
    summary: |
        My main goal is to answer questions about linguistic diversity with a focus on language variation in word meanings. I have a BA and MA degree in linguistics from the <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Humboldt University Berlin</a> and I submitted my PhD dissertation to the <a href="https://www.uni-jena.de/en" target="_blank">Friedrich Schiller University Jena</a> in August 2023. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. I am a language scientist studying patterns and causes of words with multiple meanings. For my work, I use data from language documentation, large-scale databases, and computational methods. In my Master’s thesis, I conducted the first systematic study of body part extensions such as table leg and foot of the mountain. I examined the frequency of 95 expressions in 13 languages and the preferences for underlying analogy patterns based on similarity in shape, spatial orientation, and function. The first project of my doctoral research established the Database of Cross-Linguistic Norms, Ratings, and Relations for Words and Concepts (NoRaRe), which contains 98 datasets from linguistics and psychology across 40 languages including 65 word properties.

    summary: |
        I noticed that many people spend quite some time inspecting the books on a person's shelf. I am no exception. A bookshelf is a great opportunity to find out what someone is interested in and can be a useful conversation starter. So with this collection, I would like to invite you to browse through my favourite books.
