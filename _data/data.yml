    summary: |
      I’m a language scientist and currently working as a doctoral researcher at the MPI for the Science of Human History. I studied linguistics at Humboldt University Berlin, focusing on psycholinguistics and typology. My research interest is the diversity of language variation in word meanings. In my master’s thesis, I conducted the first systematic study of body part extensions such as the table leg and foot of the mountain. I examined the frequency of these expressions in 13 languages and the preferences for the underlying similarity dimensions (shape, spatial orientation, function). For my doctoral research, I collaborated in establishing the Database of Cross-Linguistic Norms, Ratings, and Relations for Words and Concepts (NoRaRe), which contains 98 datasets from linguistics and psychology across 40 languages including 65 properties (e.g., frequency, sensorimotor ratings, borrowability).

        tagline: "A systematic typological study of body-part metaphors in object and landscape terms. The study consisted of 53 pictures illustrating object and landscape parts which were based on 93 body-part metaphors. The analysis showed that some metaphors are far more consistent across languages than others. For example, ‘leg of the chair/table’ is present throughout the whole language sample."
